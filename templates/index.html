<h2><a id="About">About</a></h2>
<p>Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in designing and developing distributed backend service-oriented
    architecture. Contributed to VMware Cloud a product which deployed SDDC to the cloud providers such as AWS.
    Contributed to an extension of Java Spring Boot Framework to add VMware specific support for service development and
    service upgrades.</p>
<p>I'm a climber, cyclist, powerlifter, boulderer, skier, and go to yoga; but at the end of the day I'm also a distance
    runner. During the summer it's fun hitting some downhill Mountain Bike at Whistler, Snoqualmie or Stevens Pass.
    During the winter I can be found at the same places with some skis.</p>

<h2><a id="Experience">Experience</a></h2>
<h4>VMware by Broadcom - Senior Software Engineer | November 2023 - August 2024</h4>
<p>Continued VMware work after Broadcom acquisition.</p>
<h4>VMware - Member of Technical Staff | October 2020 - November 2023</h4>
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS. Primarily contributed to Service Starter, owned Feature Flags. Conducted consolidation of
    Feature Flags from 5 iterative implementations into a centralized solution. Worked with the Service Starter team to
    extend the Java Spring Boot Platform to integrate with the VMware Cloud infrastructure. Work on this team included
    designing a template service of which 100s of VMC services were based, this streamlined service lifecycle (testing,
    build, deploy) so teams could worry about service logic while getting periodic upgrades to the infrastructure
    integration.</p>
<h4>Okta | March 2019 - July 2019</h4>
<p>Kept existing cloud integrations always on while mentoring new engineers in the Azuqua platform.</p>
<h4>Azuqua | August 2018 - March 2019</h4>
<p>Wore a lot of hats. Developed cloud architecture, gathered requirements from customers, triaged work for other
    engineers, and plenty of other activities to automate the world's business processes.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/yroosevelt/Roosevelt-Young-Website" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
    Roosevelt Young Website on Github </a>
<p>Current website on githuh. Flask website using deployed on Azure.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/lol_analytics" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> League Analytics on
    Github </a>
<p>A site that displays data pulled from Riot s API for their widely popular game League of Legends. This project
    includes a script to get the data from their RESTful API and put that data into an AWS RDS PostgreSQL-backed
    database. A SQL file is included to create the database schema. The data is viewable from a Python, Dash, Flask
    website on Elastic Beanstalk which is viewable <a
        href="http://lol-analytics.ycqim2bgtu.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">here</a>. Future work on this project is
    to create in-depth analytics with scikit-learn.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/roosie-site" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> roosie-site on Github
</a>
<p>Original personal website's source code on GitHub. Implemented using Python and Django. Hosted on AWS EC2.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/PerceptronOCR" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> PerceptronOCR on
    Github </a>
<p>A perceptron created using C++ in an attempt to differentiate different hand-drawn characters. This perceptron is
    made in two flavors; averaged and voted. The averaged perceptron attempts to determine which character is correct by
    finding the largest dot product of valid pixels and weights. The voted perceptron works on a similar premise, but
    each weight only counts as 1 no matter how heavy it is.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/trie/tree/master/trie" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> Trie on
    Github </a>
<p>This project is a trie implemented in C# using WinForms for the GUI. This is a simple project to exemplify the
    decoupling of frontend and backend programming.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/Pagerank-Estimator-in-C" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> Pagerank
    Estimator on Github </a>
<p>The input is a directed graph G(V,E) with n vertices and m edges. Vertices represent webpages. Edge (u,v) means there
    is a hyperlink from webpage u to webpage v (and hence this edge is directed u->v). Starting from every node in the
    graph, perform a random walk of a user-specified length K. Keep track of how many times the random walks visit each
    node. The "estimate of pagerank" for a given node u is then given by the number of times u was visited (as part of
    any random walk) divided by the total visits across all vertices.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/roosie/Overwatch-API-To-C-" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> Overwatch API
    to C# on Github </a>
<p>This project was created to easily convert the unofficial Overwatch API from JSON Objects into C# objects quickly. A
    WinForms GUI is included to prove that the parser is working correctly and view player stats on the current hero
    selection pool.</p>

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ayxb7xgpsioh2ns/apriori.py?dl=0" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
    A-Priori Algorithm on Dropbox </a>
<p>This is a script using the A-priori algorithm to find products which are frequently browsed together. The support is
    fixed to s =100 (i.e., product pairs need to occur together at least 100 times to be considered frequent) and the
    program returns the top 5 sets of items for itemset sizes 2 and 3. Implemented in Python3.</p>

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iset97rmcgx3bjd/LyricsEngine.py?dl=0" target="_blank"
    class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> Lyric Parsing on Dropbox </a>
<p>The input for this program is an artist name. Due to limitations of the Genius API, the name has to be typed
    perfectly. The script will fetch the top 4 songs that the artist is featured in and extract the number of words used
    and most common words used. Written in Python3.</p>
